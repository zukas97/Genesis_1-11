		Creation
		</h2>
		
		<p>
				The passage is pretty long so I will just paraphrase. Here is the order of creation:
			
			1. The light. (verses 3-5)
			
			2. Land, water and sky (verses 6-10)

			3. vegetation (verses 11-12)

			4. Celestial bodies: sun, moon, stars, etc. (verses 14-19)

			5. Living creatures (verses 20-25)

			6. Mankind (verses 26-27)

			God saw that all that he made was good. He made humans in his own image, and saw that they were very good. Humans are made in the image of God so we are very good in his eyes.

			Genesis 2 is a more detailed account of the creation of Mankind.

			It was before the plants had sprung up and before the Lord had sent rain on the earth. God formed a man out of dust and breathed life into him. He called him Adam No suitable helper was found so God created Woman out of one of Adam's ribs. She was called Eve. 
			God planted a garden called Eden and placed Adam and Eve in it to take care of it. They were free to eat from any of the trees exept the tree of the knowledge of good an evil.

				<h2 class="heading"> The Fall</h2>
				<p>
				The serpent was crafty and evil. He made Eve question God's authority. He convinced her to eat of the tree of life. She had Adam eat the fruit too. They became more aware, the realized they were naked, and hid from God.<br>
				This was the first sin. <br>
				When God came walking through the garden and found them hiding, they said they were afraid because they were naked. They blamed their sin on each other. God punished both them and the serpent, and banished them from Eden.
