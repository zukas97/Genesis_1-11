		Creation
		</h2>
		<p>
				The passage is pretty long so I will just paraphrase. Here is the order of creation:
			
			1. The light. (verses 3-5)
			
			2. Land, water and sky (verses 6-10)

			3. vegetation (verses 11-12)

			4. Celestial bodies: sun, moon, stars, etc. (verses 14-19)

			5. Living creatures (verses 20-25)

			6. Mankind (verses 26-27)

			God saw that all that he made was good. He made humans in his own image, and saw that
			they were very good. Humans are made in the image of God so we are very good in his eyes.

			Genesis 2 is a more detailed account of the creation of Mankind. 
			It was before the plants had sprung up and before the Lord had sent rain on the earth.
			God formed a man out of dust and breathed life into him. He called him Adam No suitable
			helper was found so God created Woman out of one of Adam's ribs. She was called Eve. 

			God planted a garden called Eden and placed Adam and Eve in it to take care of it.
			They were free to eat from any of the trees exept the tree of the knowledge of good an evil.
