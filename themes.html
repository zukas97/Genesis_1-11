		<h2 class="heading">What do these Stories Teach us About God?</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">
		These stories show how God keeps coming back to us even though we still sin. They show his great love and compasion on us.
		God could just as easily have destroyed all of humanity, but he didn't. He chose to save us because of his great love for us.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading">What do these Stories Teach us About Humans?</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">
		From these passages, we learn how people will always turn away from God, even through all he has done for them.
		This is shown through how many times people have sinned. They know it is evil in the eyes of God, and yet they will still do it.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2 class="heading">God's Judgment and Grace</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">
		Throughout these chapters God puts heavy judgment upon his people. When they sin, or go against his will, he often punishes them in some way.
		His grace and mercy are also amazing. Even though he is angry at people for disobaying him, he has mercy on them, and does not destroy them. 
		He gives them a chance to be good.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2 class="heading">God's Presence</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">
		God is ever-present in these passages. He personally deals with his people instead of just doing things in ways they can't see. He openly speaks 
		to them and is present with them. Even though he was seperated from them in heaven since "The Fall."
